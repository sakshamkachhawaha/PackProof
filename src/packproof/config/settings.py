"""Validated application settings.

`Settings` is immutable and validated, so a bad value fails when the settings object is
built rather than halfway through a download. Nothing constructs it yet: the CLI has no
command that needs a workspace, so this becomes an operating reality when a `scan`
command calls `Settings.from_env()`. Environment overrides are read explicitly in
`from_env()` instead of through a settings library: three values need configuring
today, and an implicit binding would put configuration in two places to look for.

Workspace policy
----------------
The workspace holds untrusted package content that PackProof has downloaded but not
analyzed. It must never overlap the code PackProof trusts and runs — writing scan
input into the installation directory or the source checkout would put downloaded
bytes next to the interpreter's own import path.

Therefore `workspace_dir` is rejected when it:

- is empty, whitespace-only, or names the current directory (as in "" or ".");
- contains a `..` component, at any position, in any spelling;
- carries a `~user` prefix that names no account, which is reported as a configuration
  error instead of surfacing the `RuntimeError` the standard library raises for it;
- resolves to something that already exists and is not a directory — including a symlink
  that points at nothing, because a file is not a place to extract into and a `mkdir`
  failing at extraction time is the worst moment to learn that;
- resolves (after `~` expansion and symlink resolution) to a protected root or to
  anything beneath one;
- contains a protected root, since a workspace that holds the installation lets every
  archive member name reach PackProof's own code — the filesystem root is the extreme
  case, and so is a home directory that holds a checkout.

Protected roots come from the running package and the running interpreter, never from
the current working directory:

- the `packproof` package directory, always;
- the interpreter's package roots (`sysconfig`'s `purelib` and `platlib`), whenever the
  interpreter reports usable ones. The environment imports from those directories
  whether or not PackProof was installed into them, which is what puts an editable
  install under the same rule as a wheel: untrusted content written there can shadow a
  real module either way;
- the repository root, only when three signals agree on the same directory: a
  `pyproject.toml` declaring this project, repository metadata (`.git`, which is a
  directory in a normal clone and a file in a worktree or submodule), and the package
  directory actually sitting at that candidate's `src/packproof`. Neither of the first
  two establishes identity alone — a manifest name is a copyable string, and a `.git`
  entry only says that *some* tree is versioned — and both can be dropped into any
  directory that holds a virtualenv, which is why the walk also asks whether this
  installation lives where the candidate claims. That is a structural heuristic, not
  cryptographic verification, and it recognises one layout: the `src/packproof` tree
  `pyproject.toml` builds.

The interpreter rule is asked of `sysconfig` rather than inferred from the package's
parent directory, so an unusual install whose parent is a home or working directory does
not end up banning everything beneath it. The repository rule refuses to guess, so a
wheel install or an unpacked release tarball gets package-and-environment protection
instead of a fabricated checkout root — and the default workspace stays valid there.

A workspace is refused rather than accepted when a filesystem check needed to answer any
of this fails: PackProof cannot confirm such a path is outside the protected locations,
and a permission error is not evidence of a safe directory. Each refusal names the role
of the root it reached — package directory, source checkout, or interpreter package root
— because the three call for different fixes from the operator, and the role travels with
the root from `_protected_roots_with_roles()` rather than being re-derived from the
filesystem while the message is being written: building a refusal must not add a
filesystem operation that can fail.

Two refusals that look alike are not alike. A workspace that cannot be inspected is a
property of the configured value, and naming a different directory may well fix it.
Protected locations that cannot be listed are a property of the installation, and no
`PACKPROOF_WORKSPACE_DIR` value helps while they stay unreadable — the two messages say
which of those the operator is looking at.

The default workspace is a per-platform cache directory so it does not move when the
tool is invoked from a different directory. Constructing `Settings` only computes and
validates a path: it never creates a directory. That happens later, at the operational
boundary that actually needs it.

Configuration validation is not archive-extraction security. A member path inside a
tarball is chosen by the attacker at extraction time, so the extractor must
independently bound each destination, reject unsafe members, and handle symlinks;
checking one configured directory here cannot do that job.

Secrets do not belong in this model yet. When registry or AI credentials arrive they
must be added as `pydantic.SecretStr` fields, which keeps them out of `repr()` and
therefore out of logs.

        two differ whenever a symlink is involved, and this one is re-resolved on every

        was then, so a link swapped in afterwards changes what this returns without
        changing any decision that was already made. That gap is not closed here and
